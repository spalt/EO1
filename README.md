# Electric Objects Lives!  Replacement APK

![](e01.png "e01")

## Getting started

### Requirements 

*UPDATE: In 2025, Flickr has stopped allowing free accounts to create API apps.  I am currently revisiting this project in an attempt to get it up and running using a different service*

- You need a way to connect a keyboard and mouse to your EO1.  I got one of these -- https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C6032G0/ -- and connected my USB keyboard to it, then my USB mouse to the keyboard.
- Flickr API key:  Once you've signed up for [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com), go [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/), to create an "app".  Once you walk through the short wizard, your key will look like a series of numbers and letters. You will want the **public key**.
- Flickr User ID:  Your user ID is in the URL bar when viewing your photos.  For example it is bolded in the following URL:  https://www.flickr.com/photos/ **193118297@N04** / â€” you only need the User ID, not the entire URL.  If you have a custom name in your URL there are other methods to get the userID, described [here](https://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157632667188299/).
- Upon setting up the app, it'll ask for these two pieces of info.  You can either type them in on the setup dialog, or put them into a file (the User ID, followed by a carriage return, followed by your Public API key).  Name this file **"config.txt"** and copy it to your EO1's "Downloads" folder.  (An easy way to do this is to email yourself the file then log into your email and download it using the EO1's web browser [described below]).

### Setup

- Upload some EO art to your Flickr account.  There's a good collection here:  https://github.com/crushallhumans/eo1-iframe/tree/main/eo1_caches/mp4s -- MP4 videos and still images are supported.
- Once you boot up your EO1 and it hangs on the "Getting Art" dialog, hit **WINDOWS + B** to open a web browser
- You need to tell your EO1 to allow side-loading.  Swipe down on the top right and go to Settings > Security.  In there make sure "Unknown Sources" is checked.
- Go back to the browser and go to this URL: https://github.com/spalt/EO1/releases/download/0.0.8/EO1.apk (you may need to use the mirror, [by clicking here](http://danexchtest11.cloudapp.net/private/releases/EO1.apk))
- When it finishes, install the file by pulling down the notification bar and clicking it, then agreeing to the prompts.
- Restart/power cycle your EO1
- Because this APK is designated as a "Home screen replacement", when it boots, it will ask if you want to load the Electric Object app, or the EO1 app.  Select EO1 and choose "Always".
- The first time the EO1 is run you will need to specify the information above.  Click OK to save and continue.  **To get back to the configuration screen later, push C on your connected keyboard** 
- You can now unplug your mouse and keyboard and hang your EO1 back on the wall!
- See "Partner App" below for instructions on installing the companion app on your Android device.

### Partner App

- A "Partner App" (for Android) runs on your phone or mobile device and allows you to push images or video directly from the <A href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flickr.android&hl=en_US&gl=US">Flickr Android App</a> using the share icon, assuming you are running on the same network as your EO1 device.  Running the Partner App from the Start menu of your phone allows you to skip to the next item in the current slideshow or resume the slideshow after sharing an individual item.  You can also update the current Tag (original Tag will be restored next time the device restarts), adjust brightness and change your slideshow interval.
- To install, you must allow "Unknown Sources" on your device.
